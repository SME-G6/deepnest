# Friendly Note
- This repository is a fork of the original due to numerous system failures in the previous fork (https://github.com/ahmadileham/Deepnest). Many of these issues stemmed from untested branches being merged into the main repository.
- This fork was created within this organization to ensure members of the original repository are aware that it is intended for learning purposes by Universiti Malaya students. For further context, refer to the discussion in [this comment](https://github.com/ahmadileham/Deepnest/pull/12#issuecomment-2562395238).

## This Fork

The primary goal has been to get deepnest buildable again, which has been achieved.

## Prerequisites

- **Node 20+:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). You can use the Node Version Manager (nvm):
  - [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) to download Node and change versions.
- **Python 3.7.9 and up** You can use the Python Version Manager (pyenv):
  - [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) to download and change versions.
- **Visual Studio with Desktop Development with C++ extension**
  - Install VS2022 from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/
  - or, as an administrator via `npm install --global windows-build-tools` (older VS version)

For ubuntu (or when you're not sure how to build) look at the build workflow:

https://github.com/deepnest-next/deepnest/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml#L28

### Possible Problems

- On Windows 10 1905 or newer, you might need to **disable the built-in Python launcher** via
  - **Start** > "**Manage App Execution Aliases**" and turning off the "**App Installer" aliases for Python**"
- close-and-open all command shells and your IDE to activate the latest setup

## Building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepnest-next/deepnest
cd deepnest
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Rebuild

```sh
# If you change the electron-related files (web files, javascript), a build with
npm run build

# If you change the the Minkowski files (the `.cc` or `.h` files):
npm run build-all
```

### Running

- `npm run start`

### Clean builds

```sh

npm run clean  && npm run build

# full clean, incl. `node_modules`
npm run clean-all && npm install && npm run build
```

### Create a Distribution

```sh
npm run dist

# During development, you can combine `clean-all, build-all and dist` via:
npm run dist-all
```

The resulting files will be located in `.\deepnest-<version>-win32-x64`.

Create a zip file of this folder for a simple distribution.

## Debugging

If the environment variable "deepnest_debug" has a value of "1", deepnest will open the browser dev tools (debugger/inspector).

## MacOS menu 
To enable the macOS-specific menu feature:

1. Uncomment the relevant code section in main.js for the menu template.
2. Add the Menu module to the Electron imports:
```sh
const { app, ipcMain, BrowserWindow, screen, Menu } = require("electron");

```
3. Rebuild and run the project.
